# mnist-handwritten-digit-classifier

This project demonstrates a digit classifier trained on the MNIST dataset using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The model can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy. The web application is built using Streamlit, which allows for interactive prediction and visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git
- Virtual environment tools (optional but recommended)
